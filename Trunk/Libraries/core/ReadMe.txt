Thanks to the following people who have helped in the development process or whose suggestions have led to 
improvements in the code:
- Eamon Nerbonne for the BlockingStreamReader fix (http://eamon.nerbonne.org/) which is much nicer than the
  alternative of pre-caching in a MemoryStream
- Hugh Williams and Jacqui Hand of OpenLink Software (http://www.openlinksw.com) for helping me resolve some
  issues with their ADO.Net provider including promptly providing me with a fixed version once the issue
  I'd identified had been traced to it's cause and extending my evaluation license so I could build the code
- Toby Inkster (http://tobyinkster.co.uk/) for providing me with some TriX extensibility stylesheets that I 
  could use to test my TriX parser
- Marek Safar from the Mono project for fixing the bug in gmcs I identified which meant I couldn't compile
  a Mono build of dotNetRDF
- Andy Seaborne and Steve Harris for excellent answers to various SPARQL and ARQ function library related questions 
  which have contributed to resolving various issues in the Leviathan engine and adding the ARQ function library support
- Peter Kahle for his efforts in producing a Windows Phone 7 version of the library
- Paul Hermans for various suggestions related to the improvement of the Toolkit
- The SPARQL Working Group for useful feedback and responses to my comments

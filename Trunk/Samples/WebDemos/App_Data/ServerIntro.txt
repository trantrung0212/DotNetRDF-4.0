This is a demonstration of the SPARQL Server introduced provided by dotNetRDF.
</p>
<p>
This handler the <em>SparqlServer</em> allows for setting up an endpoint which provides SPARQL Query, Update and Graph Store HTTP Protocol endpoints to end users.
</p>
<p>
You can access the <a href="/demos/server/query">Query Endpoint</a> by appending <strong>query</strong> to the Base URI of the server and similarily the <a href="/demos/server/update">Update Endpoint</a> by adding <strong>update</strong> to the Base URI of the server.  All other URIs covered by this handler are interpreted according to the Graph Store HTTP Protocol
</p>
<p>
SPARQL 1.1 Service Description documents are available by making either an OPTIONS request to any of the URIs covered by this Handler or by making a GET request to the Query/Update endpoints without specifying a Query/Update and a RDF format ahead of HTML in your Accept Header.
